<h2>About the Herbarium</h2>
<p>A herbarium is a collection of preserved plant specimens and associated data used for scientific study. These specimens are typically dried, pressed, and mounted on sheets of paper, and may also include information about the plantâ€™s habitat, location, date of collection, and the name of the collector. Herbaria serve as a vital resource for botanists, ecologists, and researchers in various fields of biological science.</p>
